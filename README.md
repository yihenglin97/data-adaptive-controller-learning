To reproduce the plots in the paper:

1. Create the Anaconda environment (or get the required packages some other way):

       conda env create -f environment.yml
       conda activate gaps

2. Run the experiments in parallel. NOTE: Will take a while.

       make -j

3. Examine output in the `Plots/` directory.
